=========================================================================================================

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results in the paper *Blinkies: Open source sound-to-light conversion sensors for large-scale acoustic sensing and applications*.

Abstract
--------

We propose an open source hardware platform called Blinky, a sound-to-light conversion sensor that harvests sound power at low-rate and in a convenient manner.
Blinkies are made up of a central processing unit connected to two microphones and a few light-emitting devices, are powered by a battery, and protected by a robust enclosure.
Distributed in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle.
We give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential applications.
We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made.
We provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and signal acquired by the video camera.
Because each sensor is potentially affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements.
The effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment.
Finally, we demonstrate sound source localization using a hundred-and-one actual Blinkies in highly reverberent environment.
